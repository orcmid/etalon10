                   ETALON 1.0 WORD PUZZLER COMMAND-LINE GAME

                     SOURCE CODE VERSION CONTROL REPOSITORY
                     --------------------------------------

    etalon10 is a command-line game by which players attempt to guess a
    word given initial information and clues about each successive guess.
    
    The game is patterned after the Bulls and Cows game.  The original
    inspiration is presentation of Bulls and Cows in Section 02 of Udemy's
    "The Unreal Engine Developer Course - Learn C++ and Make Games" online
    course.  Additional information about the game is found in the Game
    Design Document, etalon10-GDD.txt, in the GitHub repository.
    
    Etalon 1.0 is renamed to feature the provision of a fully-featured
    command-line version that is not oriented as preparation for making
    games using the Unreal Engine.  The etalon10 version is free-standing
    and organized as an open-source project on the nfoWare nfoTools pattern 
    for command-line applications.

TODO

  * Add GitHub Readme.md when ready.
  
  * Cover toolcraft and the intention of relying exclusively on freely-
    available software tools and libraries.
    
  * Explain the licensing approach and handling of open-source code and any
    contributions to it.
       
  * Add dev/ folder and a WinCon/ subtree for compiling etalon10.exe 
    versions and their companion materials for Windows.
    
  * Provide more connection between etalon10 and the Section02 project of
    the Unreal Developer course.
    
  * Add some indication of origin in the NOTICE.txt file, including how to
    obtain the instructor-derived version.
    
  * Scrub the Game Design Document, tie it to etalon10 here and on nfoWare,
    and also point to the origin of the GDD.
    
  * The 5Ps for etalon10 need to be accountd for as well, whether in this
    synopsis, any README.md, and at nfoWare d170201.
