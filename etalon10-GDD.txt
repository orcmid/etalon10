                  ETALON 1.0 COMMAND-LINE GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT
                  ============================================

    This is the command-line game that is used as an Introduction to C++ in
    the Udemy "Unreal Engine Developer Course: Learn C++ & Make Games" at
    <https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse>.  The Game Design Document (GDD)
    development arises at Section 02, Lecture 11.  The command-line version
    is developed over the entire course of Section 02 to establish the use
    of Visual Studio Community Edition and Visual C++ which will later be
    used beneath the Unreal Engine in subsequent sections.
    
    This particular solution deviates from that of the course in significant
    ways and it should be examined as a source of alternative ideas and not 
    as an appropriate achievement of the objectives of Section 02.  Beginners
    should follow the exact treatment in the course and not be distracted by
    the deviations made here.
    
    This document is to be maintained.  It is expected that some of the 
    narrative of this document will be worked into the code structure itself.
    
1. THE PROBLEM

   Provide a mental challenge for the player.
   
   Have it work for youngsters and adults who have learned to read and spell
   English.
   
2. CONCEPTS AND RULES
   See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows> [2].

   The program chooses an English isogram word, one that has no repeating 
   letters.  Examples are "rules", "tough", "begin", "trowel", "burglar",
   "cough", "counsel", "cuneiform", "human", "computer", "software", "isogram",
   and many more.  The most popular forms uses 4/5-letter words.
   
   The player is asked to enter a guess for what the n-letter secret word is.
   
   The program reports the number of Bulls, letters in the same place as in
   the secret word, possibly 0.
   
   The program reports the number of Cows, letters in the secret word but not 
   in the same place, also possibly 0.
   
   If the word has not been guessed yet, the player is allowed another guess
   until the limit on guesses is reached.
   
3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
   
   Accomplish it with a simple command-line program using text input-output.
   
   Start with the simplest console application that demonstrates game play.
   
   INPUTS  
   
     * The program has a list of at least one word that can be chosen from. 
     
     * Keyboard input is text in response to promtps from the computer.  
       Only the 26 letters A ... Z are accepted and case does not matter.
       
   OUTPUTS
   
     * All output is in text lines.
     
   USER INTERACTIONS
   
     * For each play, the computer randomly chooses one of its words.
   
     * The user will be told how many letters there are in the word to guess
       and also how many tries are allowed.
     
     * The user will be asked to submit a guess.
     
     * If the guess is not an isogram of the correct length, 
       the user will be asked to try again.
     
     * If the guess is a good isogram the user will be told the number of Bulls
       and Cows.
       
     * If the word has not been guessed yet, and the limit of guesses has not
       been reached, the user is invited to make another guess.
       
     * If the word has been found (n Bulls), the user is congratulated.
     
     * If the limit on guesses has been reached, the user is commiserated with
       and told what the word is. [dh:2016-12-25 This is generally not a good
	   idea.  We don't want to give users hints about what the dictionary is,
	   and the user can try again, can even notice when there starts to be
	   a previously-remembered pattern.]
       
     * For either outcome, the user is offered the choice of another play.
       
   ASSETS
   
     No assets are required beyond an initial list of words (or a single word).
     
4. ARCHITECTURE

   We are going to do bottom-up spiral construction since this is an easy
   problem.

   A form of Model-View-Controller will be applied.  The Model class
   is only about the secret-holder offering methods that answer particular
   questions about the current guess.

   The view is about the presentations, and that might not be easily separated
   from control in the case of a console application with only line input-output.
   The interactions will be separated even though operation is synchronous [7].
   
   For convenience of deployment and of operation, a batch script is used 
   for initiation, similar to Adv10 release operation (not dev building), and
   the creation of a shortcut that can be placed anywhere is also provided. 
   (See [6].)
   
   This will be an elementary deployment model and not consider side-by-side
   versions or anything like that.  
   
   The deployment model will be with release builds, also.  And the notion of
   always having everything needed in a release and only in a release will be
   applied.  This is more process (i.e., software/systems engineering), not
   program architecture so much.
     
5. POSSIBLE FUTURE IDEAS

   For play-testing it might also be interesting to introduce the idea of an 
   auto-play mechanism, providing a way to demonstrate the guessing procedure.  
   This is not unlike having a solver.

   Use list of more than one choice for the secret word
   
   Let the user choose the maximum length of hidden word to be offered.
   
   Minimize the odds of a word being repeated.
   
   Provide a way to create the word list, shuffle it (e.g., by hashing), 
   and work randomly through it.  A scrabble dictionary that is filtered
   for isograms would be perfect.  This might also be a good way to determine
   complexity using the scrabble score for a word.  However, changing the
   suggested limit based on that is a clue, so we can't use it in the
   guessing, only perhaps in scoring.

   In competitive use the trick is to have two players attempt the 
   same words, though not necessarily in the same sequence.  Then determine 
   the number of times a player achieved fewer tries on the same word
   as the opponent, the winner being the player with the most fewer tries.
   There might even be a sudden-death playoff.

   It is not clear that the word should be revealed.  I have added a 
   caveat about that.  

   Develop a solver that will algorithmically produce guesses.  This 
   works best, in one sense, if the guesses do not have to be known 
   English words.  If the solver has access to the same word list, 
   that can be even better, since letter patterns can be filtered
   for and this can lead to more rapid elimination in some cases.

   Something to take advantage of in a solver is the fact that we
   don't actually care what the letters are, in reducing to a
   set of WordLength() letters, they are just as good as x[0], x[n-1]
   and we only care about position.  Basically we are reducing a
   candidate set.  At the beginning, elimination of candidates is
   as useful as confirming candidates and establishing their positions.
   The middle game is the trickiest as is blending the end game into
   the middle game.

   There is also the matter of finding out what the optimum play tree
   is.  There is background on this, although it is a little difficult
   to figure out how the existing diagrams work.  Also, the optimum
   tree may depend on the corpus of words, and it varies by word
   length.  This requires some heavy analysis and it may be better
   to do that in something like F# or Python or something else that
   handles lists very well.

   For a solver, I have this feeling about tri-state Booleans, such
   as occur in circuit simplifiers: 0, 1, 2 for true, false, don't care.
   Not quite the same thing, but interesting.  This is for searching
   words.  I am guessing about this.  Don't have an useful conception.

   Knuth [4] mentions minimax strategies, which also means alpha-beta 
   pruning might be applicable.  There are rich recreational-
   computing explorations possible with this.  It would be useful
   to make a dedication to Fred Gruenberger in that respect.

6. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

   [1] Wikipedia.  Letter Frequency.  
		<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency>
		Relative frequency of letters in large samples of English
		words: e t a o i n s h r d l c u m w f g y p b v k j x q z
		Relative frequency of first letters in large samples of
		words: t o a w b c d s f m r h i y e g l n p u v j k q z x
		These might best be derived from a corpus of isograms of
		each length, though.

		Notes no. 192.  CLSI Publications (Stanford, CA: 2011)
		ISBN 1-57586-584-X.
		   Bulls & Cows is mentioned in a few asides.  If we don't
		consider that isograms must also be actually-used English
		words, the alphabet itself is not so important as there 
		simply being 26 symbols from which n-length terms are to
		be guessed.

		ISBN 1-57586-584-X.
		   This is related to Bulls & Cows in that it provides a
		way of guessing 5-letter words that in some manner work
		through getting disjoint arrangements of x letters in
		in <= x tries.  More recreational computing that may be
		adaptable to Bulls & Cows guessing.  Note: Knuth is not
		limiting this exploration to isograms.
		
	[6] See <https://github.com/orcmid/Adv10/tree/master/dev/WinCon> for
	    the evolution of this idea, but for deployment, not development.
	    The generic case is evolving on <http://nfoWare.com/dev> notes and at
	    <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/tree/master/devKits/WinDev/WinConKit>
	
	[7] Because all interactions in the command-line version of BullCowGame
	    are synchronous, the View [Model] considerations are rather 
	    different.  Yet there is important need for separation.  One is
	    that the View becomes separately testable.  In some sense this
	    is lost in the collapsed VC, as it were, of PlayGame, although the
	    testing of incomplete PlayGame is suggestive.  I am not clear that
	    the View should directly access the model, even though it could.  If
	    we were using interfaces, it might be more appropriate to have the
	    View access an interface that is a bit more abstracted and constrained,
	    although I have doubts about that.
	       See <http://stackoverflow.com/a/3540895/33810> and also recognition
	    that MVVM is a *pattern*, even though illustrated by a common usage,
	    <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848246.aspx>.  So is MVC,
	    although some treatments are too tied to a particular implementation
	    case, as at <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649643.aspx>.
		     
 
/* ------1---------2---------3---------4---------5---------6---------7------ */

TODO:

  * Reworkd this document to reflect etalon10 project structure and direction.

  * Touch up the completed version enough so that it can become a frozen 0.1.0
    branch prior to forking this into an nfoTools-based command-line project.
    
  * AFTER freezing the 0.1.0 branch, change the project structure to use a 
    src/ and dev/ split and put the VS project in the dev/ tree.  Challenges
    and experiments/sandboxes for all of that will come post 0.1.0, including
    all of the desired customizations.
    
  * Find a better name for the forked version.  It will not be project 
    Section02 but it needs decent solution, project and .exe names.  It 
    would be cool to have it be an isogram.
  
  * Create a separated view class.  It somehow does not need to see the
    whole model, but it needs some access in order to form messages properly.
    Should it do that, should its methods receive parameters, or should it have
    a restricted view of the model?  Figure this out.  We want minimal coupling,
    but perhaps quite a bit more than none.
