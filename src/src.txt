TODO

 * Provide more history and tie into the nfoWare materials.
 
 * Add something about the origin of this code as a separate file or in
   the individual source files, so that the code this is based on can be
   found separately.
   
 * Make changes of names sufficient for this code to compile properly.
 
 * Complete the refactoring so that the code is consistent for etalon10
   and standing alone.
   
 * Tie everything to GitHub locations and to the nfoWare folio d170201
   on etalon10 development.
   
 * Add any TODOs here from scrubbing the source files.
 
 * Refer to the Game Design Document too.
