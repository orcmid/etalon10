                    ETALON10 DEVELOPER CONSTRUCTION SETS
                    ====================================

    The developer construction sets are platform-specific structures for 
    compiling and exercising the etalon10 software.  
    
    In this approach, the code is always compilable and executable as
    we work through the x.y.z semantic versions.  There should always be
    tests for confirmation of the results as well.  When there are version
    releases, the construction set will build the developer version of  
    release that it is contained in.
    
    For etalon10, the WinCon construction set is designed to provide an entry-
    level exercise for novices who wish to construct the etalon10 program for 
    themselves as introduction to coding for fun, computer programming for 
    everyone (CP4E), and a little software-engineering for everyone (SE4E)
    as well. 
    
    The main thrust for the etalon10 project is demonstrating development on 
    and for the Microsoft Windows platform. Other platforms and construction 
    will be entertained as supplementary options.  
    
    Developer versions of etalon10 lack detailed branding for the installed
    program.  Essential parameters for branding and delivery via app stores
    and other means are omitted.  Each provider of authenticated and 
    verificable versions must provide their own secure authentication along 
    with appropriate branding.  The purpose of this separation is to impede 
    counterfeiting and to reveal imposter versions of the software targeting
    innocent end-users. 
    
    In all other respects, development of etalon10 provides code in the open 
    made completely available under an open-source license.

TODO

 * Work up the Visual C++ console compilation case, WinCon
 
 * Add something about where devKits for constructions sets are found.
 
 * Add something about developing/maintaining construction sets.
   This can be by appropriate pointers.
 
 * Get to the first level of clean compilation for an executable null 
   implementation, and work a form of test-driven spiral development.
